# pi-subagent-router

Selective specialists with isolated context and bounded execution.

Choose none, single or parallel for independent investigations or review. Children run in separate processes with fresh sessions, explicitly scoped filesystem tools and an environment allowlist. Write children require isolated worktrees and explicit user configuration.

## Install

Requires Node >= 22.19 and Pi **1.2.0**. Install this Git repository with Pi:

```sh
pi install git:github.com/Borges360/pi-subagent-router
```

From a local checkout:

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
pi -e ./src/extension.ts
node dist/cli.js doctor
```

The source entry point is loadable directly by Pi; npm packages include source and
compiled JavaScript/declarations. No sibling extension, SQLite driver, remote
classifier or Durable installation is required for the default file backend.

## Use

Run `/subagents` for the interactive menu, or `/subagents status` for structured
headless output. Domain actions: `status, show, explain, delegate <agent> <objective>`. Shared actions: `auto`, `off`,
`observe`, `config`, `doctor`, `storage status`, `storage migrate files|sqlite|durable`.
The CLI uses the same actions: `node dist/cli.js status`.
TUI grouping: Children / Decisions / Settings. Config opens a small mode wizard in the TUI; headless config
returns validated settings. Edit the user config for advanced settings.

Default state: `~/.pi/agent/state/pi-subagent-router/projects/<sha256-of-canonical-repository-root>/`.
`PI_ECOSYSTEM_STATE_ROOT` changes the parent state directory for testing or deployment.
No project state is written implicitly.

## Guarantees and validation

Versioned optional events, bounded actions, optimistic record versions, secret
redaction at output boundaries, checksum validation, append-only journal and
fail-closed persistence. The same storage conformance tests run against files,
SQLite and pinned Pi Durable 1.2.0. Fault tests kill a real process after a durable
journal commit, race two processes and reject corrupt snapshots or symlink escapes.

```sh
npm test
npm run lint
npm run benchmark
npm pack --dry-run
```

This is a development release. Local correctness/recovery results do not establish
SWE-bench/Terminal-Bench quality or inference-cost savings. See [benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md)
and [acceptance status](ACCEPTANCE.md) for the limits of the evidence.

Git checkouts include the compiled worker and CLI. CI checks that a rebuild matches
the committed distribution. Autoskills and subagent-router pin the Pi SDK as a runtime
dependency for their isolated child process; the other extensions use the host SDK.
